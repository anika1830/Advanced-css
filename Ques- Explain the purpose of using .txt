Ques:- Explain the purpose of using the var() function in css. Also you have created two buttons with id named
primaryBtn and secondaryBtn which should be given background colors using the var() function. The color
code for primaryColor is #00b7ff and secondaryColor is #6c757d.

Ans :- CSS variables have access to the DOM, which means that you can create variables with local or global scope.
 A good way to use CSS variables is when it comes to the colors of your design. Instead of copy and paste the
 same colors over and over again, you can place them in variables.

Syntax of the var() Function

The var() function is used to insert the value of a CSS variable.

Syntax: var(--name, value)

To declare a variable in plain CSS, place two hyphens in front of the custom name you choose for the variable, 
or property, then use the var() function to place that value wherever you desire:

How the var() function Works

    1. First of all: CSS variables can have a global or local scope.
    2. Global variables can be accessed/used throughout the entire document, while local variables can be used
        only inside the selector where it is declared.
    3. To create a variable with global scope, declare it inside the: root selector. The :root selector matches
       the document's root element.
    4. To create a variable with local scope, declare it inside the selector that is going to use it.

Advantages of using var()

   1. makes the code easier to read (more understandable)
   2.  makes it much easier to change the color values
